							<h1 class="major">Circe's Island</h1>
							<p>I'd like to start today's post off with a moment of silence for Elpenor. He was a brave soul, that died tragically.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>I'd like to also give thanks to Circe, who has been housing me for a while now, and also provided the funeral venue for Elpenor.</p>
							<p>Alright, now that <em>that's</em> over, we can go back to our normal scheduled program. Circe, taking me by the hand, drew me away from all my shipmates there and sat me down and lying beside me probed me for details. She told me about the sirens, Scylla, and Charybdis. I think she was trying to fear monger me, because honestly, I think I can chop off Scylla's six heads or whatever. She said that Scylla is immortal, but it's not like I haven't fought some strong enemies before.</p>
							<p>I don't think she knows just how powerful I am, but whatever. She also told me to plug my ears to the noise of the Sirens, but why would I do that? If they are going to sing praise, why wouldn't I want to hear it? I mean, I guess she knew this, so she also suggested having my crewmen tie me up so I can't escape.</p>
							<p>After that, I should get to Thrinacia, the island of the Sungod Helios. I was desperately warned to not slaughter the cattle on this island. Circe was really scary there. She said something like <em?>"And even if you escape, you'll come home late, all shipmates lost, and come a broken man."</em> That shook me, so I'll probably tell my crew to chill out when they see the cows. I don't wanna be cursed again.</p>
							<hr>
							<p>Thank you for reading my first blog post. I have been meaning to stay in touch with my fans for a long time, and this is the best way to do it. I have spent a lot of effort into making this portal for all my Odysseians, and I hope you like it!</p>
