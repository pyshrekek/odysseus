							<h1 class="major">Sailing Out</h1>
							<p>My crew and I immediately set sail from Circe's island, as soon as dawn hit. My crew was ready to go, and that lovely Circe sent us our farewells. I told my shipmates about the plan to bind me to the mast so I could hear the song.</p>
                            <p>We were gallantly strolling on the seas, when the wind suddenly stopped. This was it. The plan came into action - the oarsmen leapt to their feet, struck the sail, stowed it deep in the hold and sat to the oarlocks, thrashing with polished oars, frothing the water white.<sup><a href="../odyssey.pdf" target="_blank">[Pg. 201]</a></sup></p>
							<p>But this peace did not last for long. Everything grew dark and quiet, and we all knew the sirens were coming. My crew tied me up and refused to set me free, even when I was screaming for it. <em>I truly appreciate them for that.</em> It was a good idea to tie me up, because otherwise my life may have ended there. I knew the sirens would have killed me, but their song was just that good! "We know all the pains that Achaeans and Trojans once endured on the spreading plain of Troy when the gods willed it so"<sup><a href="../odyssey.pdf" target="_blank">[Pg. 202]</a></sup>: no one has understood me like this before...</a></p>
							<p>But the sirens were just a little distraction. Next came Scylla. Honestly, Circe was right - it was really scary. But I'm not a coward, so as THE Odysseus would, I put on my armor and went to fight it. I would have saved my crew, but Scylla was hellbent on targeting them and not me. I would have easily destroyed Scylla if it gave me a chance to. My men were too scared to retaliate. What a bunch of babies.</p>

							<p>Thank you for reading my second post! It's been a long journey and I trust that it will be over soon. I see land and some cows - hopefully we are allowed to eat these ones. To my friends and family in Ithaca, I hope this message reaches you: I will be back soon. Mark my words.</p>
