							<h1 class="major">Found Land</h1>
							<p>We landed on Helios' island, but we were STARVING. But we must hold on, I warned my crew. I didn't even want to land here in the first place, and I definitely do not want to anger the gods again.</p>
							<p>I made them swear that they would not kill ANY animals. Not one man among us—blind in his reckless ways— will slaughter an ox or ram.<sup><a href="../odyssey.pdf" target="_blank">[Pg. 205]</a></sup> But it was not looking too hopeful. The wind never came, and we were stranded on this island. My crew tried their best, they really did. But it wasn't sustainable. We were stuck, and we had to hunt for fish or birds every day. But we were surviving.</p>
                            <p>But that little rascacl, Eurylochus, cheered on his stupid crewmen. I could not convince my crew otherwise, and we ended up slaughtering the cattle. We definitely angered the gods, since the meat was already writhing with bugs within minutes. That dumbass, I knew that I never should have let him do anything. What's next, they're going to start a sailors union?</p>

							<p>I really hope this isn't the start of something bad. Please, Poseidon. I really didn't mean to.</p>
